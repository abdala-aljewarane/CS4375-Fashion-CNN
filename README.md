## üìù Project Overview
This project implements and compares two CNN architectures (LeNet-5 and VGG16) for fashion item classification across two datasets of varying complexity. We investigate how model architecture affects performance when scaling from simple to complex fashion datasets.

### Research Questions
1. How does model complexity affect classification accuracy across different fashion datasets?
2. How well do models trained on simple datasets (Fashion-MNIST) generalize to complex real-world fashion images (DeepFashion2)?
3. What are the computational trade-offs between lightweight and deep architectures?

## üèóÔ∏è Implemented Architectures
- **LeNet-5**: Classic lightweight CNN (62K parameters)
- **VGG16**: Deep convolutional network (138M parameters)
- **Modified LeNet-5**: Enhanced version with batch normalization and dropout (85K parameters)

## üìä Datasets

### 1. Fashion-MNIST
- 70,000 grayscale images (28√ó28)
- 10 fashion categories: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot
- Clean, centered, preprocessed images

### 2. DeepFashion2
- 491K images with 13 clothing categories
- Real-world images with varied poses, occlusion, and backgrounds
- For this project, we use a subset:
  - 50,000 images (5,000 per category)
  - Resized to 64√ó64 for computational efficiency
  - 10 categories selected to match Fashion-MNIST where possible
